# [Website here](https://greygoosevx.github.io/YuGiOh-historic-and-custom-formats/)
This project allows the user to play custom and historic YuGiOh formats

To offer this, I use a google sheets table with all cards, that I created myself:

The webapp creates custom card pools and allows to create .conf files for old formats
It's tested to work well with [Project Ignis](https://projectignis.github.io/download.html)
